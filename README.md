# Orbital
## About
Orbital is an astronomy-oriented bot with tons of extra features! It utilizes NASA's Open APIs for cool commands like NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day, images from NASA's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) camera aboard their DSCOVR spacecraft, as well as showing information of the International Space Station (ISS), such as its location on a map, current astronauts aboard, and its coordinates. Outside of astronomy, Orbital has nice analytics features such as commands to return information about the server, members, roles, and the bot itself. Additionally, Orbital uses slash commands for easy usage and organization. With many features to come and an active development team, feedback for improvement is always welcome!

## Installation
Currently there's only one way to install the bot on your server - cloning this repository and running it with node. In the future, I plan to add Docker and NPM as viable ways to deploy the bot. As of now, however, follow these steps for installation:

1. Clone repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/Smoothbrains-xyz/Orbital.git
```
2. Enter repo and install dependencies
```
cd nasa-bot && npm i
```
3. Run the bot:
```
npm run prod
```

## Notes
### Creating a Discord Application/Bot
To create your own application and bot using the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers), go to the previous link and sign in. Then create a new application, and click bots on the left. Configure it to your liking, and then copy the token.

That's the most important part of your bot *and don't share it with anyone*.
